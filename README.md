## Python_Game

The provided code is a Python program for a number-guessing game with both single-player and two-player modes. Here is a brief summary of the main components and functionalities:

## Imports:
random: For generating random numbers.
openpyxl: For handling Excel files.
getpass: For securely getting input from players without echoing.

## Constants:
RUTA_EXCEL: The path to the Excel file used for storing statistics.

## Functions:
obtener_numero_aleatorio(): Generates a random number between 1 and 1000.
solicitar_numero(mensaje): Prompts the user for a number input securely.
verificar_numero(eleccion, numero_adivinar, intentos): Checks if the player's guess is correct and provides feedback.
jugar(intentos, modo_doble=False, numero_adivinar=None): Manages the gameplay loop for either single or two-player modes.
dificultad_menu(): Displays a menu to select the difficulty level and returns the corresponding number of attempts.
guardar_estadistica(nombre_jugador, resultado): Saves the game result to an Excel file.
leer_estadistica(): Reads and displays the game statistics from the Excel file.
main(): The main function that provides a menu for starting the game, viewing statistics, or exiting.

## Game Flow:
The player selects a game mode or views statistics from the main menu.
In single-player mode, the player guesses a random number generated by the computer.
In two-player mode, one player sets the number to guess, and both players take turns guessing.
The game tracks the number of attempts and provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
The result is saved, and statistics can be viewed from the menu.
The code aims to create an interactive number-guessing game with persistent scorekeeping using Excel files. ​​
